# PCI Compliance Guidelines

This document outlines the PCI compliance measures implemented in our application to ensure secure handling of payment information.

## Overview

Our application uses Stripe for payment processing, which is a PCI-compliant payment processor. This means we never directly handle, store, or transmit credit card data on our servers. Instead, all payment information is securely processed by Stripe.

## Key Security Measures

### 1. No Direct Card Storage

- We never store credit card information on our servers
- All payment data is processed directly by Stripe
- Only Stripe payment method IDs are stored for recurring payments

### 2. Secure Payment Processing

- We use Stripe Elements for secure payment form rendering
- Payment information is collected directly in Stripe-hosted iframes
- All sensitive data is encrypted in transit using TLS

### 3. Security Headers

We implement the following security headers:

- **Content-Security-Policy**: Restricts which resources can be loaded
- **Strict-Transport-Security**: Forces HTTPS connections
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: Prevents MIME type sniffing
- **X-Frame-Options**: Prevents clickjacking attacks
- **X-XSS-Protection**: Provides basic XSS protection
- **Referrer-Policy**: Controls referrer information
- **Permissions-Policy**: Restricts browser features

### 4. HTTPS-Only Cookies

- All cookies are set with the `Secure` flag
- Cookies use `HttpOnly` to prevent JavaScript access
- Cookies use `SameSite=Strict` to prevent CSRF attacks

### 5. Webhook Security

- Stripe webhooks are verified using signatures
- Each webhook request is validated against our webhook secret
- Webhook processing is idempotent to prevent duplicate processing

## Implementation Details

### Payment Form

Our payment form uses Stripe Elements, which provides:

- PCI-compliant form fields
- Real-time validation
- Automatic formatting
- Support for various payment methods

### API Endpoints

- `/api/payment/create-intent`: Creates a payment intent for Stripe
- `/api/webhooks/stripe`: Handles Stripe webhook events

### Database Schema

Our database schema is designed to avoid storing sensitive payment information:

- `Payment` table stores only non-sensitive payment metadata
- `PaymentMethod` table stores only Stripe payment method IDs
- No credit card numbers, CVV, or expiration dates are stored

## Security Best Practices

1. **Regular Security Audits**: We conduct regular security audits of our payment processing
2. **Vulnerability Scanning**: We use automated tools to scan for vulnerabilities
3. **Access Controls**: Strict access controls are implemented for payment-related data
4. **Logging and Monitoring**: All payment activities are logged and monitored
5. **Incident Response Plan**: We have a documented incident response plan for security events
