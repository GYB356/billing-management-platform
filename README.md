## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 16
- Redis server
- PostgreSQL database

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/billing-management-platform.git
cd billing-management-platform
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration
```

4. Run database migrations:
```bash
npm run migrate
```

5. Start the development server:
```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Architecture

### Core Components

- **API Layer**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **Caching**: Redis with compression
- **ML Models**: TensorFlow.js with caching
- **Monitoring**: Winston logging with performance tracking

### Security Features

- Request rate limiting
- Input validation and sanitization
- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control
- Secure password hashing
- API key management

## Testing

Run the test suite:
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run in watch mode
npm run test:watch
```

## Development

### Code Style

The project uses ESLint and Prettier for code formatting:
```bash
# Lint code
npm run lint

# Format code
npm run format
```

### Pre-commit Hooks

The project uses Husky for pre-commit hooks:
- Linting
- Code formatting
- Type checking
- Test running

### Documentation

- API documentation is available at `/api-docs` when running the server
- TypeScript types and interfaces are documented using JSDoc
- Comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring
