# Data Archiving Strategy

## Overview
This document outlines our approach to data archiving in the Invoice Management System. As our application generates and stores critical business data, proper archival strategies are essential for maintaining performance, ensuring compliance, and preserving historical information.

## Objectives
- Maintain application performance by preventing database bloat
- Ensure regulatory compliance by preserving data for required retention periods
- Provide access to historical data when needed
- Minimize storage costs while maintaining data integrity
- Implement efficient backup and restore procedures

## Data Classification
We classify data into the following categories to determine appropriate archival strategies:

### 1. Transactional Data
- **Definition**: Primary business records including invoices, payments, and customer transactions
- **Retention Policy**: 7 years (or according to local tax regulations)
- **Archival Frequency**: Quarterly for data older than 1 year

### 2. User Activity Data
- **Definition**: System access logs, user actions, authentication attempts
- **Retention Policy**: 2 years
- **Archival Frequency**: Monthly for data older than 3 months

### 3. System Metrics and Performance Data
- **Definition**: Application performance metrics, error logs, API response times
- **Retention Policy**: 6 months (detailed), 2 years (aggregated)
- **Archival Frequency**: Weekly for data older than 1 month

## Archival Implementation

### Database Level Archiving
1. **Partitioning Strategy**
   - Implement time-based partitioning for high-volume collections (invoices, audit logs)
   - Older partitions will be archived and removed from the main database

2. **Archive Collections**
   - Create separate archive collections with optimized indexes
   - Apply compression to archived collections
   - Consider using cold storage for rarely accessed archives

### Application Level Archiving
1. **Scheduled Jobs**
   - Implement automated jobs that run during off-peak hours
   - Use incremental archiving to minimize system impact
   - Include validation steps to ensure data integrity

2. **Archive Service**
   - Develop a dedicated microservice for handling archive operations
   - Implement retry mechanisms and transaction support
   - Provide APIs for searching and retrieving archived data

## Storage Solutions

### Primary Archives (1-2 Years)
- Stored in a separate MongoDB database with appropriate indexes
- Regular backups and replication for data safety
- Direct API access for retrieval with appropriate authentication

### Long-term Archives (2+ Years)
- Export to cost-effective storage solutions (e.g., Amazon S3 Glacier)
- Implement lifecycle policies to transition to cold storage
- Maintain metadata index in primary database for quick reference

## Data Restoration Process
1. **Request Handling**
   - Implement a formal request process for data restoration
   - Require appropriate authorization for accessing archived data
   - Document all restoration requests for compliance

2. **Restoration Procedures**
   - Develop tools for selective data restoration
   - Implement verification steps to ensure restored data integrity
   - Provide temporary access to restored data with expiration

## Compliance and Auditing
- Maintain detailed logs of all archival and restoration activities
- Generate monthly reports on archived data and storage utilization
- Conduct quarterly audits to ensure compliance with retention policies
- Provide necessary documentation for regulatory audits

## Technical Implementation
```javascript
// Example archiving job for invoices
async function archiveInvoices() {
  const cutoffDate = new Date();
  cutoffDate.setFullYear(cutoffDate.getFullYear() - 1);
  
  // Find invoices eligible for archiving
  const invoicesToArchive = await Invoice.find({
    createdAt: { $lt: cutoffDate },
    archived: { $ne: true }
  }).limit(BATCH_SIZE);
  
  // Process in batches
  for (const invoice of invoicesToArchive) {
    // Copy to archive collection
    await ArchiveInvoice.create({
      ...invoice.toObject(),
      archivedAt: new Date(),
      originalId: invoice._id
    });
    
    // Mark as archived in the source collection
    await Invoice.findByIdAndUpdate(invoice._id, {
      archived: true,
      archivedAt: new Date()
    });
    
    // Log the archival operation
    await ArchiveLog.create({
      collection: 'invoices',
      documentId: invoice._id,
      archivedAt: new Date()
    });
  }
}
```

## Monitoring and Optimization
- Track archive job performance and optimize as needed
- Monitor storage growth rates and adjust archival frequency
- Review and update retention policies annually
- Optimize query performance for archive collections

## Disaster Recovery
- Maintain multiple backup copies of archived data
- Implement cross-region replication for critical archives
- Conduct quarterly recovery tests to verify restoration capability
- Document recovery time objectives (RTOs) for different archive types

This strategy will be reviewed and updated annually to reflect changing business requirements, technological advancements, and regulatory updates.
