## Applying Taxes to Invoices

   - Calculate the total amount including tax

### Tax Calculation Details

- Subtotal = Sum of (Quantity × Unit Price) for all items
- Tax Amount = Subtotal × Tax Rate
- Total = Subtotal + Tax Amount

## Tax Reports

### Viewing Tax Reports

2. Select a date range using the date picker
3. View the following information:
   - Total revenue for the period
   - Total tax collected
   - Tax breakdown by rate
   - Monthly trend chart

### Exporting Tax Reports

2. Click the "Export" button
3. Choose your preferred format (CSV, Excel, PDF)

## Best Practices

1. **Tax Rate Naming**
   - Use clear, descriptive names
   - Include the rate percentage in the name
   - Example: "VAT (20%)"

2. **Active/Inactive Rates**
   - Keep only current tax rates active
   - Archive old rates by marking them inactive
   - This prevents accidental application of outdated rates

3. **Tax Rate Validation**
   - Ensure rates are between 0 and 100
   - Avoid overlapping active rates
   - Document any special conditions or exemptions

4. **Regular Reviews**
   - Review tax rates periodically
   - Update rates when tax laws change
   - Verify calculations in reports

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Tax Not Calculating**
   - Verify the tax rate is active
   - Check if the tax rate is selected in the invoice
   - Ensure all item prices are entered correctly

2. **Incorrect Tax Amount**
   - Verify the tax rate percentage
   - Check for any special rounding rules
   - Ensure the subtotal calculation is correct

3. **Missing Tax Reports**
   - Verify the date range selection
   - Check if there are invoices in the selected period
   - Ensure proper permissions are set

### Getting Help
