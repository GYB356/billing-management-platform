   ```
   This will upgrade Next.js and PostCSS, addressing the critical security issues.

   ```
   ExcelJS is a modern alternative without the reported vulnerabilities.

3. **Update Code for Breaking Changes**:
   - Test the application thoroughly after upgrades
   - Update any code that relies on specific behavior of the upgraded packages

4. **Implement Security Scanning**:
   - Add GitHub Dependabot alerts
   - Set up regular npm audit checks in CI/CD pipeline
